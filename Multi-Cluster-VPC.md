# Why You Should Not Create Multiple Clusters in One VPC

Creating multiple clusters in a single **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is generally discouraged due to the following reasons:

## 1. IP Address Exhaustion
- Each cluster requires a large number of **IP addresses** for nodes, services, and pods.
- Multiple clusters in the same VPC can lead to **IP conflicts** and depletion of available IP ranges.

## 2. Network Complexity & Overhead
- Kubernetes clusters have their own **internal networking** (pod CIDRs, service CIDRs).
- Managing network policies, routing, and overlapping CIDRs across multiple clusters in a single VPC becomes complex.

## 3. Security Risks
- Sharing a VPC means clusters **share the same network space**.
- If one cluster is compromised, attackers may **laterally move** to other clusters.
- Isolating clusters in separate VPCs improves **security boundaries**.

## 4. Resource Contention
- Multiple clusters in a single VPC **share network bandwidth** and other AWS/GCP/Azure resources.
- This can lead to **performance degradation** and unpredictable behavior.

## 5. Scaling & Maintenance Challenges
- VPC limits (such as **Elastic Load Balancers, NAT Gateways, and VPNs**) apply to all clusters.
- Managing **network rules, IAM permissions, and DNS** across multiple clusters can become complex.

## 6. Compliance & Governance
- Many organizations require **strict isolation** of environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
- Keeping clusters in separate VPCs ensures **better compliance** with security policies.

## When Might You Use Multiple Clusters in One VPC?
- **Small environments** where IP exhaustion is not an issue.
- **Multi-cluster service meshes** (e.g., Istio) that require close communication.
- **Testing scenarios** where full isolation isn't a priority.

## Best Practices
- Use **separate VPCs** for different clusters.
- If you must use one VPC, carefully **plan CIDR allocations** to avoid conflicts.
- Implement **network policies and segmentation** to improve security.
