# **How CNI Works in AWS EKS Cluster**

## **1. What is CNI in AWS EKS?**
Container Network Interface (**CNI**) is a networking framework that allows container orchestrators like Kubernetes to configure network interfaces dynamically. In AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (**EKS**), the **Amazon VPC CNI plugin** is used as the default networking solution. This plugin allows Kubernetes pods to get IP addresses directly from the Amazon **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**, enabling seamless communication between pods and other AWS resources.

---

## **2. AWS VPC CNI Plugin Overview**
The **AWS VPC CNI Plugin** is a Kubernetes CNI plugin that allows pods to use native Amazon VPC networking. It:
- Assigns an **Elastic Network Interface (ENI)** from the worker node's VPC subnet.
- Allocates **IP addresses** to pods from the VPC subnet.
- Supports **high-performance networking** features like AWS Nitro, SR-IOV, and enhanced networking.

## **3. How AWS VPC CNI Works**
When a new pod is created in an EKS cluster, the **CNI plugin** follows these steps:

### **Step 1: ENI and IP Address Allocation**
1. The VPC CNI plugin runs as a **DaemonSet** (`aws-node`) on each worker node.
2. The plugin checks the **available ENIs** and **IP addresses**.
3. If needed, the plugin **attaches a new ENI** to the node using AWS APIs.
4. It then assigns **secondary private IP addresses** to the ENI from the VPC CIDR range.
5. These IPs are stored in the **IP address pool**.

### **Step 2: Assigning IP Addresses to Pods**
1. When a new pod is scheduled on a worker node:
   - The kubelet requests an IP address from the CNI plugin.
   - The CNI plugin selects an available IP from the **IP pool**.
   - It configures the network interface in the podâ€™s network namespace.
   - It updates Kubernetes with the podâ€™s assigned IP.

### **Step 3: Routing and Pod Communication**
- Since pods use **VPC-native IP addresses**, they communicate directly using AWS networking.
- There is **no need for NAT or overlay networks** like Flannel or Calico.
- The ENIs are attached to EC2 instances, and traffic flows through the **VPC routing tables**.

## **4. AWS VPC CNI Configuration**
The VPC CNI plugin is controlled by environment variables in the **`aws-node` DaemonSet**. Some key settings include:

| Environment Variable | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `WARM_ENI_TARGET` | Number of extra ENIs to keep available |
| `WARM_IP_TARGET` | Number of extra IPs to keep pre-allocated |
| `MINIMUM_IP_TARGET` | Minimum number of IPs to allocate |
| `MAX_ENI` | Maximum number of ENIs a node can allocate |

To check the current configuration:
```sh
kubectl get daemonset aws-node -n kube-system -o yaml
```

To modify a setting:
```sh
kubectl edit daemonset aws-node -n kube-system
```

---

## **5. IP Address Management in AWS VPC CNI**
The number of IPs assigned per node depends on the **instance type**. Each instance has:
- A **primary ENI** (used for node-level networking).
- Multiple **secondary ENIs** (used for pods).
- Each ENI can have a fixed number of **secondary IP addresses**.

For example, an **m5.large** instance has:
- **3 ENIs**
- **10 IPs per ENI**
- **(3 ENIs x 10 IPs) - 1 primary IP = 29 pods per node**

To check IP allocation:
```sh
kubectl exec -n kube-system aws-node-xxxxx -- ipamd --show-ipam
```

---

## **6. Scaling and Performance Optimization**
To optimize pod networking in EKS:
- **Increase `WARM_IP_TARGET`**: Ensures pre-allocated IPs are available for fast pod startup.
- **Use `PREFIX_DELEGATION`**: Enables IPv4 prefix assignment for better IP utilization.
- **Monitor IP usage**: Use `ipamd` metrics with **CloudWatch** for monitoring.

---

## **7. Limitations of AWS VPC CNI**
- **IP Exhaustion**: Limited by the number of available IPs in the VPC.
- **ENI Limits**: The number of pods per node is restricted by EC2 ENI limits.
- **Cross-Region/VPC Communication**: Requires VPC Peering or AWS Transit Gateway.

---

## **8. Alternative CNI Solutions**
While AWS VPC CNI is the default, you can use alternative CNIs:
- **Calico**: Provides Network Policies and can use BGP for routing.
- **Cilium**: Uses eBPF for high-performance networking.
- **Weave**: Supports overlay networking.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **AWS VPC CNI Plugin** integrates Kubernetes networking with AWS VPC, ensuring high performance and security. Understanding its configuration and limitations helps in optimizing network performance in an EKS cluster.
